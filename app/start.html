  <h1>Getting Started</h1>

  <p class='intro'>So, you have decided to learn to sing, and you might be confused about how to get started. Not to worry! Below, you will find answers to a couple of questions that can help guide your practice and allow you to get the most from your training sessions.</p>

  <div class='question'>
    <p class='question-title'>How long should I practice?</p>

    <p>The length of the practice session depends on your level of expertise. Someone who is new to singing can benefit from practicing 15 to 20 minutes a day. Gradually increase the practice time to 30 to 60 minutes per day and the warm-up portion appropriately. However, quality practice is better than quantity. Focusing for 20 minutes of creative practice is better than unfocused practice for an hour. The voice is like any other muscle group in your body. It becomes fatigued and needs rest. If your voice is tired after 20 minutes, rest for a time and sing again later.</p>

    <p>If your voice hurts while you're practicing, then something isn't right. You may be pushing too hard to make the sound. Take a break. Fatigue is normal and the muscles will feel warm and tired. But, stop practicing when the fatigue sets in, and the recovery won't take as long. As long as the voice is back to normal after a few hours of rest, then your practicing is on the right track. Improvement happens with frequent practice. You can't expect to practice once and be perfect. Your goal for practicing is to make improvements in your sound. Longer endurance may happen, but it's not necessary for a beginner to practice for three or four hours a day. Set goals for each practice session for consistent progress.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='question'>
    <p class='question-title'>What's the best time to practice?</p>

    <p>Schedule a specific time and duration for practicing each day. If the practice time is allotted on your calendar, you're more likely to practice. Decide if you're a morning person or an evening person. Many singers practice more efficiently at night because of their body clocks. You can also practice on your lunch hour or right before or after work. If your house gets plenty of traffic during the day, practicing in the evening when it's quiet may be more convenient. Or if your home is usually overwhelmed with familial comings and goings in the evening or early morning hours, then you may want to schedule a time in the middle of the day. To maximize your concentration, turn off the TV and turn on the answering machine during your daily practice time.</p>

    <p>Have your practice space set and ready each day. If you have to search the entire place to find all your practice tools, you'll waste valuable singing time. Be organized, so you can enjoy your time being creative!</p>

  <div class='question'>
    <p class='question-title'>How do I get the most out of my voice?</p>

    <p>You need to involve your whole body when you're singing. Some tips to do this: </p>

    <p class='answer-part'><b>Keep good posture.</b> In order to have the best air flow and therefore the best sound, you need to have good posture. This goes for when you're both sitting and standing. Imagine a line at the top of your head, through your back, holding you up.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you're standing, keep your feet flat on the floor, shoulder width apart. Balance equally on both legs. Keep your head up and shoulders back. Every part of your body should be in the same line.</li>
      <li>If you're sitting, follow the same recommendations as you would for standing, but also keep your back off the chair, sitting toward the edge of your seat.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class='answer-part'><b>Breathe deep.</b> Most people have a bad habit of only using the top of their lungs. Doing this though doesn't employ the diaphragm and doesn't let you use your full power.</p>
    
    <p>If you are tense at all while breathing, it will resound in the muscles of your vocal folds. Breathe normally, but be conscious of keeping your shoulders low and your chest relaxed. Concentrate on breathing lower staying loose throughout your core. If you need to, place a hand on your stomach to remind yourself that that's the part that should be moving up and down -- not your chest and shoulders. Hold an "s" sound (like a hiss) when you exhale to control the amount of air that you can expel.</p>
    

    <p class='answer-part'><b>Release your jaw.</b> Any tension at all will keep you from your best sound. Your jaw is the instrument your voice comes out of -- you have to take care of it, too.</p>
    
    <p>Massage your checks with the heel of each hand. Push in and down right below your cheekbone and rotate in a clockwise motion. Your jaw should open without you even thinking about it and be forced to relax. Do this several times.</p>
